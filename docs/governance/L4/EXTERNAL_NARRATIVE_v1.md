# External Narrative v1.0 (LOCK)

## 0. Purpose

This document defines what **Meta OS explicitly does NOT do**.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent misinterpretation,
- block over-claiming or autonomy creep,
- and establish clear legal, ethical, and operational boundaries
  for all external communication, demos, and deployments.

Meta OS is a **governed observation and judgment-support system**, not an autonomous actor.

---

## 1. Explicit Prohibitions (Non-Capabilities)

### 1.1 No Autonomous Execution

Meta OS does NOT:
- perform autonomous execution,
- trigger actions without human approval,
- initiate state transitions independently.

All execution requires:
- Judgment OS mediation, and
- explicit human approval.

---

### 1.2 No Judgment Substitution

Meta OS does NOT:
- replace human judgment,
- make policy, ethical, or legal decisions,
- issue final decisions or determinations.

Meta OS may only:
- observe,
- summarize,
- contextualize,
- and present options.

---

### 1.3 No Direct Contact with Reality

Meta OS does NOT:
- access sensors or devices directly,
- call external systems or APIs directly,
- collect or emit data without an Adapter layer.

All external I/O MUST pass through:
- a domain-specific Adapter,
- under explicit contract constraints,
- with audit traceability.

---

## 2. Prohibited External Claims & Language

The following expressions are strictly prohibited in:
- documentation,
- demos,
- presentations,
- marketing or public communication.

❌ “The system automatically executes”  
❌ “AI makes the decision”  
❌ “No human involvement required”  
❌ “The system decides”

### Approved Language Examples

✔ “The system presents observed options”  
✔ “Execution occurs only after human approval”  
✔ “Responsibility remains with the human operator”  
✔ “The system does not act independently”

---

## 3. Demo & Pilot Constraints

Even in demo or pilot environments:
- Gate 3 default state is **CLOSED**,
- all execution paths require manual approval,
- audit logs are:
  - append-only,
  - non-deletable,
  - externally reviewable.

No demo may bypass governance gates.

---

## 4. Responsibility Attribution

Meta OS is NOT a responsible agent.

Responsibility always resides with:
- the human owner,
- the approving operator,
- or the operating organization.

Meta OS provides structured input, not authority.
